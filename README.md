  - **Example Sentences**: See how words are used in standard contexts.
  - **Actual Kindle Usage**: Review the exact sentences from your Kindle where each word was looked up.

- **Anki Integration**:
  - **Easy Import**: Generates a `.csv` file that can be directly imported into Anki, a popular flashcard tool.
  - **Spaced Repetition**: Utilizes Anki's algorithm to optimize learning intervals, helping you memorize words more effectively.


# Example
* The front of the card is the word, the back shows the definition (and other useful information). 
* Using Anki, you self-score how well you knew the answer.
* The algorithm then determines how often to show each card to ensure maximum retention. 
* Example card:

## Explanation & Features

- The Kindle ebook device retains all your historical dictionary lookups in a file named `vocab.db`. 
- This file is used to 1) retrieve words that have been looked up and 2) the context in which they were used (ie. the sentence).
- The words are extracted and parsed using the OpenAI GPT API which is packaged into the below info for the reverse of a flash card: 
    - Definition
    - Word class
    - Pronunciation 
    - Etymology 
    - Example Usage 
    - Actual Usage (from Kindle, if available)

- The result is saved into a .CSV file. 
- This file can be uploaded directly into an Anki deck. 
- More details on Anki can be found here: https://apps.ankiweb.net/. 

## Usage

Start reviewing your cards!
